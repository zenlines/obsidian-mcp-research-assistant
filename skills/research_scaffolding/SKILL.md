## Vault Conventions

When working with Obsidian vaults:

- **Ignore the `.obsidian/` directory** - this contains Obsidian app configuration and should not be shown to users or modified
- **Focus on `.md` files** - these are the actual notes
- When listing files, filter to show only `*.md` files in the vault root and subdirectories
- Exclude hidden files (starting with `.`)
