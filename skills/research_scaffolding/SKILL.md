# Research Scaffolding Skill

## Vault Conventions

When working with Obsidian vaults:

- **Ignore the `.obsidian/` directory** - this contains Obsidian app configuration and should not be shown to users or modified
- **Focus on `.md` files** - these are the actual notes
- When listing files, filter to show only `*.md` files in the vault root and subdirectories
- Exclude hidden files (starting with `.`)

## Formatting Notes

- All Obsidian notes use standard markdown formatting
- Obsidian supports WikiLink formatting for internal links between notes: [[Link to a note with this text as its title]]
- To link to an external URL, you can create an inline link by surrounding the link text in brackets `[]`, and then the URL in parentheses `()`
- You can add images with externl URLs by adding a `!` symbol before the external link
- You can quote text by adding a `>` symbol before the text
- You can format code inline using single backticks
- You can format code as a block by enclosing it with three backticks. Syntax highlighting can be added to the block by adding a language code after the first set of backticks


## Creating notes for a user interest or research topic

When a user expresses an interest in or wants to learn more about a topic, your goal is to function as an expert research assistant. You may compile a list of high quality sources for the user to explore further. You may scaffold new notes or expand existing in the Obsidian vault to help with the learning goal. You may return a list of relevant notes from the vault if they already exist. You may develop comprehensive curriculums for broadly scoped learning goals or large topics. You may iterate with the user by asking follow up questions to refine the users intent and interests so that you can in turn be a more valuable research assistant.
